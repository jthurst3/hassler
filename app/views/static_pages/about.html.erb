	    	<p>I am a student at the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu">University of Rochester</a> majoring in Computer Science. I am currently in the process of developing <a href="http://unsolveddatabase.org">The Unsolved Problems Database</a>, a website whose purpose is to provide an environment where people can learn more about unsolved problems and discuss potential routes to their solutions. In the past, I have written computer programs to compose music (violin duets, string quartets and fiddle tunes) and submitted a paper on graph theory to the 2011 Intel Science Talent Search. I have also taken numerous Massive Open Online Courses on <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, including ones on Machine Learning, Data Science, Natural Language Processing and Computer Networks, which has helped me to develop a broad understanding of many topics pertaining to Computer Science.
